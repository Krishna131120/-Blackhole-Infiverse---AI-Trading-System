- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to original analysis if LLM fails
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing prediction system

## üìä Example Output

### Before (Original Format)
```
**LONG RECOMMENDATION** (Score: 0.723)

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:**
‚Ä¢ Momentum: Strong bullish momentum
  - RSI oversold (28.3) - bullish momentum
  - Stochastic oversold (15.2)
‚Ä¢ Trend: Strong uptrend
  - Price above both SMAs - strong uptrend
```

### After (LLM-Generated Format)
```
AAPL is a strong buy opportunity right now, and I'm confident in my recommendation. The key reasons for this are the stock's clear uptrend, strong bullish momentum indicators, and high volume confirmation. Let's break it down: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 28.3, which is considered oversold, indicating that the stock has fallen too far and is due for a bounce. This is also supported by the Stochastic and Williams %R indicators, which are both oversold as well. In simple terms, these indicators are saying that the stock has been dropping too fast and is likely to rebound soon.

Another important factor is the stock's trend. AAPL's price is above both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which is a strong indication of an uptrend. This means that the stock has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows, and it's likely to continue moving in this direction. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is at 32.5, which confirms that the trend is strong and sustainable. This combination of indicators gives us a clear picture of a stock that's on the rise.

I've considered the potential risks and concerns, and I don't see any major red flags. The stock's low volatility and normal volume levels reduce the risk of a sudden price drop. Additionally, the positive market sentiment alignment, as indicated by the bullish sentiment and low put/call ratio, suggests that investors are generally optimistic about the stock's future performance. Overall, I believe that AAPL presents a strong buying opportunity, and I'm confident in my long recommendation with a confidence score of 0.723.
